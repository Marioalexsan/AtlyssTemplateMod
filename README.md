# ATLYSS Template Mod using BepInEx 5

This is a VS 2022 project that can be used as a basis for making BepInEx 5 plugins for ATLYSS.

To be able to properly utilize this project, you'll need Python 3 installed. It is used for running prebuild and postbuild scripts.

You also need to have BepInEx 5 already installed in the game's folder, so that the template can grab the dependencies from there.

You can download BepInEx 5 from here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2
